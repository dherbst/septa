# septa
Septa golang client and command line executable for getting the next regional rail train to arrive.  This project uses the https://www3.septa.org/ API.

## Installing
The simplest way to install and get going is to run:

    go install github.com/dherbst/septa/cmd/septa@latest

If you have `~/go/bin` in your `$PATH` then you can type `septa` to run the executable.

## Build

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/dherbst/septa?style=flat-square)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/dherbst/septa)

To build the command, clone this repo, then type `make`.  The septa executable will be copied to `$HOME/bin`.   Prerequisite is that you have `docker` installed, and `$HOME/bin` is on your `$PATH`.

    git clone https://github.com/dherbst/septa
    cd septa
    make

You can create a bash alias to make looking up the next to arrive for your favorite stations:

    alias nta="septa next Narberth \"Suburban Station\""

Alternatively, you can use the `go install` command which should install the `septa` binary to `$HOME/go/bin`:

    git clone https://github.com/dherbst/septa
    cd septa
    make install-local
